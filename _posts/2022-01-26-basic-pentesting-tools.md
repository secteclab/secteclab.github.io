The world of Pentesting, already wide when focused on web applications, servers, computer networks or infrastructure, becomes even more intricate -but no less interesting and exciting- when talking about penetration tests focused on mobile applications. The later ones are the medium on which today, thanks to the rise of digitalization, human beings depend to carry out a large part of their tasks, many of them related to the consumption of entertainment services, financial applications and banking.

Derived from this, it becomes imperative the necessity for ethical hacking teams to professionalize and focus more and more on this type of penetration testing. And also to have an effective arsenal that facilitates the work of detection and invariable mitigation of vulnerabilities or security holes that put at risk the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information of the users or of the organizations that offer their services through the mobile application.

For this reason, throughout this article we will talk about the basic tools that a Pentester must know and become familiar with when it comes to mobile applications.

## MobSF

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an open source all-in-one application written in Python for analyzing mobile applications. MobSF is a complete testing environment that enables static and dynamic testing on Android (APK), iOS (IPA), and Windows Mobile (APPX) executables. MobSF can also perform security tests on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) with its Fuzzer API, which can collect information, analyze security headers, identify specific API vulnerabilities such as XXE (XML External Entity), XSS (Cross Site Scripting), route transfer, IDOR (Insecure direct object references), etc.

The static analyzer it has is capable of performing code review, permission detection, encryption level, inadequate or insecure configurations, use of dangerous APIs and malicious code, as well as leaking sensitive information. All this is carried out with the use of the following tools:

-APKiD: Gives you information about how an APK was created. Identifies many compilers, packers, and obfuscators.

-Jadx: Allows you to decompile the application.

-Quark Engine: Performs a search for threats within APK files, DEX.

To perform dynamic analysis, MobSF runs the application in a virtual machine or on a previously configured device and detects application problems in real time, capturing traffic and deciphering log and error reports.

This security analysis suite for mobile applications presents the results of its analysis in dashboards within its interface, and these can be exported in pdf file as a findings report. That is why today MobSF turns out to be an excellent starting point for the rapid analysis of mobile applications, since it offers an overview of how an application is built, the permissions it uses to function, as well as a qualifying score for the security of the app.

## Apktool and Android Studio

Apktool is a tool for reverse engineering binary, closed, and third-party Android apps. You can decode resources to their almost original form and rebuild them after making some modifications. It also makes easier working with an app by providing a directory structure of code and resources as if it were an Android Studio project. For this reason, Apktool turns out to be one of the most important tools in the arsenal of a Pentester for Android mobile applications, because code extraction for later analysis can be performed, understanding of flows and business logic, thus facilitating the identification of vulnerabilities that are related with programming and implementation of the application.

Thanks to this tool, an ethical hacker can reproduce certain fragments or flows of an application for which they do not have source code. Subsequently, a dynamic analysis of those can be performed through Android Studio (Androidâ€™s mobile applications development IDE), or, source code modification can be done, to consecutively re-compile the complete application that allows a Pentester to debug it.

## Burp Suite

Burp Suite, also called the Pentester's Swiss Army Knife, is a fundamental tool on computer security realm, created by the company PortSwigger and written in Java that allows security tests to be carried out, mainly in web applications.

Among its basic functions, there is the proxy server that allows traffic to be inspected and modified by performing a Man in the Middle attack between the browser and the target application. There is also a vulnerability scanner that automates the detection of various types of vulnerabilities of web applications, as well as a repeater that is used to modify and forward individual requests to the server.

Of the aforementioned characteristics, the proxy server stands out, whose functionality can be exploited for the dynamic analysis of a mobile application when it communicates with a web server to consume services. In the case of a mobile application developed on Android, the capture of web requests can be easily carried out on a device or emulator with an Android 5.1 version or lower, and only requires the installation of a PortSwigger digital certificate generated in Burp Suite. However, if the analysis is going to be performed on an application that is only available for more recent versions of Android, it is necessary to perform the SSL Pinning Bypass by adding other modules such as Frida-gadget within the APK, or the rooting of the device and installation of Frida Server in its full version.
