The world of Pentesting, already wide when focused on web applications, servers, computer networks or infrastructure, becomes even more intricate -but no less interesting and exciting- when talking about penetration tests focused on mobile applications. The later ones are the medium on which today, thanks to the rise of digitalization, human beings depend to carry out a large part of their tasks, many of them related to the consumption of entertainment services, financial applications and banking.

Derived from this, it becomes imperative the necessity for ethical hacking teams to professionalize and focus more and more on this type of penetration testing. And also to have an effective arsenal that facilitates the work of detection and invariable mitigation of vulnerabilities or security holes that put at risk the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information of the users or of the organizations that offer their services through the mobile application.

For this reason, throughout this article we will talk about the basic tools that a Pentester must know and become familiar with when it comes to mobile applications.

## MobSF

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an open source all-in-one application written in Python for analyzing mobile applications. MobSF is a complete testing environment that enables static and dynamic testing on Android (APK), iOS (IPA), and Windows Mobile (APPX) executables. MobSF can also perform security tests on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) with its Fuzzer API, which can collect information, analyze security headers, identify specific API vulnerabilities such as XXE (XML External Entity), XSS (Cross Site Scripting), route transfer, IDOR (Insecure direct object references), etc.

The static analyzer it has is capable of performing code review, permission detection, encryption level, inadequate or insecure configurations, use of dangerous APIs and malicious code, as well as leaking sensitive information. All this is carried out with the use of the following tools:

-APKiD: Gives you information about how an APK was created. Identifies many compilers, packers, and obfuscators.
-Jadx: Allows you to decompile the application.
-Quark Engine: Performs a search for threats within APK files, DEX.

To perform dynamic analysis, MobSF runs the application in a virtual machine or on a previously configured device and detects application problems in real time, capturing traffic and deciphering log and error reports.

This security analysis suite for mobile applications presents the results of its analysis in dashboards within its interface, and these can be exported in pdf file as a findings report. That is why today MobSF turns out to be an excellent starting point for the rapid analysis of mobile applications, since it offers an overview of how an application is built, the permissions it uses to function, as well as a qualifying score for the security of the app.
